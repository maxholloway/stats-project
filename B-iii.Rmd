              '2010_sqf_m35.csv')

# Code for the proportion test
``` {R}
sqf2010.c <- sqf2010[sqf2010$contrabn==1, ]
x1 <- sum(sqf2010.c$arstmade)
n1 <- length(sqf2010.c$arstmade)

sqf2010.nc <- sqf2010[sqf2010$contrabn==0, ]
x2 <- sum(sqf2010.nc$arstmade)
n2 <- length(sqf2010.nc$arstmade)

prop.test(x=c(x1, x2), n=c(n1, n2), alternative="two.sided",

# Answers to Questions
The proportion of people carrying contraban that were arrested is 0.84104145; the proportion of people who were not carrying contraban that were arrested is 0.05301302; $H_0: p_1 = p_2$; $H_1: p_1 \neq p_2$; the p-value is $2.2*10^{-16}$, showing that is extremely unlikely that the proportions are the same (we reject the null hypothesis that claims the proportions are the same).
